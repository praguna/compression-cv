# Image Compression Using GAN's

This repo is implementation on paper ["High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression" by Mentzer et. al.](https://hific.github.io/) 
which is a GAN based generative image compression using information theoritic shannons rate distortion loss and entropy coding EG(Encoder E & Decoder G) architecture 
to create a compression of images in latent space. We also
